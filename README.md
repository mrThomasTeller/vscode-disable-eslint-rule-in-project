![Usage](usage.gif)

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=artembakharev.disable-eslint-rule-in-project

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to quickly disable an ESLint rule directly from the editor. The code for this extension was generated by Chat GPT 4.

## Features

- Adds a "Disable rule {rule-name} in project" option to the Quick Fix menu for ESLint errors.
- Automatically updates the ESLint configuration file in your project to disable the selected rule.
- **Full ESLint 9 support**: Works with both new flat config (`eslint.config.js/mjs/cjs`) and legacy config formats (`.eslintrc.*`).
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing projects.

## Requirements

This extension works in conjunction with the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for Visual Studio Code. Ensure that you have the ESLint extension installed and properly configured in your project.

## Usage

1. Open a JavaScript file with ESLint errors.
2. Hover over the error and click on the lightbulb icon that appears (or press `cmd+.` or `ctrl+.`).
3. Select the "Disable rule {rule-name} in project" option from the Quick Fix menu.
4. The extension will update your ESLint configuration file, disabling the selected rule for the entire project.

## Known Limitations

- This extension supports most ESLint configuration file formats:
  - **ESLint 9 flat config**: `eslint.config.js`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.cjs`
  - **Legacy formats**: `.eslintrc.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.eslintrc`, `package.json`
  - Other formats like `.yml` and `.yaml` are not supported.
