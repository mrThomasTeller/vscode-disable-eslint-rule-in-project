![Usage](usage.gif)

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=artembakharev.disable-eslint-rule-in-project

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to quickly disable an ESLint rule directly from the editor. The code for this extension was generated by Chat GPT 4.

## Features

- Adds a "Disable rule {rule-name} in project" option to the Quick Fix menu for ESLint errors.
- Automatically updates the ESLint configuration file in your project to disable the selected rule.
- Supports both legacy ESLint configuration formats and new flat config format.
- Works with CommonJS flat config files (`eslint.config.js`, `eslint.config.cjs`) with automatic modification.
- Provides manual instructions for ESM flat config files (`eslint.config.mjs`).

## Requirements

This extension works in conjunction with the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for Visual Studio Code. Ensure that you have the ESLint extension installed and properly configured in your project.

## Usage

1. Open a JavaScript file with ESLint errors.
2. Hover over the error and click on the lightbulb icon that appears (or press `cmd+.` or `ctrl+.`).
3. Select the "Disable rule {rule-name} in project" option from the Quick Fix menu.
4. The extension will update your ESLint configuration file, disabling the selected rule for the entire project.

## Known Limitations

- This extension supports `.eslintrc.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.cjs`, `package.json` (legacy formats), and `eslint.config.js`, `eslint.config.cjs`, `eslint.config.mjs` (flat config formats).
- For ESM flat config files (`eslint.config.mjs`), automatic modification is not supported due to limitations with dynamic imports. The extension will show manual instructions instead.
- Legacy config formats like `.yml` and `.yaml` are not supported.
